Hi,

Thanks for using our services at hntTax to compile your HNT mining rewards summary. We didn't find any Helium rewards for the wallet address {{ wallet }} for tax year {{ year }}. We need a valid 51-character Helium wallet address to compile the rewards summary. You can find this in the Helium explorer web app or in the Helium mobile app. 
Our team of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) at hntTax are available to help you with preparing the forms needed to report your Helium mining activity for this tax year. If you pay US taxes, and this is something that would be helpful to you, please view our services page to learn more.
